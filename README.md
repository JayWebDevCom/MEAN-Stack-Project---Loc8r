## Loc8r
Loc8r is an example of a fullstack application built in Javascript. It is an express based web application that lists cafes and their corresponding facilities. It also allows for site visitors to leave reviews.

### Description
This application is driven by a mongo database via a mongoose module. It also uses the jade view engine. It demonstrates a great use of Model-View-Controller implementation and routes, controller logic and views are separated and dynamic.

The view files include javascript and HTML mixins meaning that they are dynamic and can render information for a variety of different cafe subjects which have different attributes and characteristics.

The application uses API logic and the request module to effectively make requests to the API segment of its codebase and retrieve and process JSON responses.
